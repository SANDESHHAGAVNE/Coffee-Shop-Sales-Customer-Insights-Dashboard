# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Customer-Insights-Dashboard
☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard
Project Overview

📌 Situation
A coffee shop with three store locations in New York City provided transaction data from January to June 2023. As a Data Analyst, the objective was to analyze customer purchase behavior and build an interactive Excel dashboard to help the business identify sales trends, customer patterns, and growth opportunities.

🔍 Step 1: Data Preparation
Opened the transaction dataset and reviewed the number of records and the date range (min and max dates).

Identified the types of products sold.

Created new columns using Excel formulas to enable deeper analysis:

Revenue = Price × Quantity

Month Name = TEXT(Date, "mmm")

Weekday = TEXT(Date, "ddd")

Hour of Transaction = HOUR(Time)

📊 Step 2: Data Exploration via Pivot Tables
Used Pivot Tables to uncover patterns:

Monthly Revenue Trends

Number of Transactions by:

Day of the Week

Hour of the Day

Product Category

Revenue and Quantity Sold by Product Type

📈 Step 3: Dashboard Creation
Created dynamic charts and visuals using Excel based on the pivot data.

Added Slicers to make the dashboard interactive by filtering data based on date, product type, and category.

✨ Key Insights & Recommendations
