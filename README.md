# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Customer-Insights-Dashboard
About this project
Situation
A coffee shop has three store locations in New York City.
You have been provided transaction data from Jan-Jun 2023. As a data analyst, your job is to analyze the data and understand the purchase behaviour of the customers.
The company want you to build them a dashboard that they can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for business.

Step 1
I opened the Excel file with the transaction data and familiarized myself with it.
Looked at how many records are there. The max and min date so that we can come to know the date range.
Looked at what type of products were sold.
Use Excel formulas to add new columns for robust analysis.
Like
Revenue = price * quantity
Month name = TEXT( date, ''mmm'')
Weekday = TEXT(date, ''ddd'')
Hour = HOUR(time)

Step 2
Started exploring the data using Pivot Tables showcasing
Revenue by Month
The total number of transactions made by day of week, hour and product category.
The total number of transactions and revenue by product type

Step 3
Once done with creating pivot tables now it was time to build a chart using the appropriate chart type.

Key Insights and Recommendations
There has been a growth in the revenue month by month.
Most transactions take place on Mon, Thur and Fri.
It seems that the coffee shop is mostly busy in the morning i.e. from 7-10 am.
Regarding beverages like Coffee and Tea, Barista Espresso has the most revenue generated.
But when it comes to quantity sold Brewed Chai Tea is sold the most with revenue generated of $77,082 which is less than the Barista Espresso (most generated revenue).
Price can be increased for these products in order to generate more revenue for Barista Chai tea and Gourment brewed coffee as it is sold the highest.
